# Optimization algorithms

This is my implementation of some optimization algorithms, along with their example problems:


* Bisection method
* Golden ratio method
* Successive parabolic interpolation (parabolic approximation)
* Newton's method in optimization
* Armijo's rule (First Wolfe's condition)
* Nesterov momentum (NAG)
* Nelder-Mead algorithm
* Tabu search
