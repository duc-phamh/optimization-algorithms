# Optimization algorithms

This is my implementation of some optimization algorithms, along with their example problems:


* Bisection method [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e1WWu6qgtyq5lW4AVknk1VmPqh53a8CB?usp=sharing)
* Golden ratio method
* Successive parabolic interpolation (parabolic approximation)
* Newton's method in optimization
* Armijo's rule (First Wolfe's condition)
* Nesterov momentum (NAG)
* Nelder-Mead algorithm
* Tabu search
